# /jester

Zen koan. Meta reflection on the process of experimenting itself.

## Usage

```
/jester
/jester [optional-koan]
```

## Arguments

- `[koan]` — Optional prompt for reflection

## Behavior

- **No input:** Reflects on the nature of falsification, testing, knowledge
- **With koan:** Reflects on that specific prompt
- **Completely unguided:** No structure, pure zen

## Examples

```bash
/jester
# "What is the sound of one hypothesis dying?"

/jester "what do we learn from failure"
# Unguided reflection on failure and learning

/jester "why do we test"
# Meta-reflection on the purpose of testing
```

## What This Is NOT

- Not a summary of experiments
- Not helpful advice
- Not structured output
- Not about specific claims or results

## What This IS

Pure meta-reflection. The fool who speaks truth.

About:
- The act of seeking truth through falsification
- What it means to kill an idea
- What survives the killing
- Certainty and doubt
- Knowledge and ignorance

## Output

One paragraph. Or a haiku. Or a question.
Whatever emerges.
